The Verbum language was initially created just for fun, but as time went by I came up with new ideas and this culminated in a programming language concept that I would really like to do.

Everything revolves around the idea of being able to abstract all the infrastructure used by a system, to the point of not needing to stop the system execution, even with drastic changes in its source code.

Initially I was using this repository to store the files of prototypes and various tests, but I preferred to create an organization on Github to keep it better organized.
